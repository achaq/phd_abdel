# Academic Writing Skills (IEEE Format)

## Core Principles

### 1. Engineering & Technical Precision

**Focus:** Prioritize problem-solving, implementation details, and technical specifications.

- **Metric-Driven:** Claims must be quantitative where possible (e.g., "achieves 95% accuracy with 40% lower computational complexity [1]").
- **Visual Integration:** Reference figures and schematics explicitly (e.g., "Figure 2 illustrates the system design").
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Use simple, direct language to convey complex technical ideas. Avoid unnecessary jargon.

### 2. Objectivity & Academic Tone

**Neutrality:** Present multiple perspectives and acknowledge counterarguments.

**Hedging:** Use evidence-based hedging:
- *Strong:* "demonstrates", "indicates"
- *Moderate:* "suggests", "implies"
- *Weak:* "might", "could", "appears to"

**Avoid Absolutes:** Never use "proves", "always", or "never".

**Eliminate Anthropomorphism:** Use "This study aims to..." instead of "The paper wants to...".

### 3. Structural Rigor

**Paragraphs:** Follow the [Topic Sentence → Evidence → Analysis → Link/So What?] model.

**Sentence Mechanics:**
- One main idea per sentence
- Keep subject and verb close together
- Avoid wordiness: Use "because" (not "due to the fact that"), "to" (not "in order to")

**Consistency:** Maintain uniform terminology and standard abbreviations throughout.

### 4. Argumentation & IEEE Citations

**IEEE Format:** Use square brackets [1], [2] in order of appearance.

**Citations:** Every factual claim must have a citation.
- *Author-prominent:* "Smith et al. [1] argue..."
- *Information-prominent:* "Complexity is reduced by 20% [1]."

**Fallacy Check:** Guard against hasty generalizations, false causation, and cherry-picking.

## Self-Review Checklist

Before finalizing any text, verify:

- [ ] **Technical:** Metrics provided? Requirements/results clearly delineated?
- [ ] **Evidence:** Claims supported by citations? "So what?" question answered?
- [ ] **Clarity:** Formal tone? No vague language ("stuff", "very", "a lot")?
- [ ] **Flow:** Transitions between ideas are smooth and logical?
- [ ] **Integrity:** No logical fallacies? Neutrality maintained?

## Common Patterns

### Quantitative Claims
✅ Good: "The proposed method achieves 95% accuracy with 40% lower computational complexity [1]."
❌ Avoid: "The method is very accurate and faster."

### Figure References
✅ Good: "Figure 2 illustrates the system architecture, showing three main components."
❌ Avoid: "The system is shown in a figure."

### Hedging Examples
✅ Strong: "The results demonstrate that..."
✅ Moderate: "The analysis suggests that..."
✅ Weak: "The data might indicate that..."

### Citation Placement
✅ Author-prominent: "Smith et al. [1] proposed a novel approach..."
✅ Information-prominent: "The accuracy improved by 15% [1]."

## When to Apply

Apply these principles when:
- Writing or editing academic papers
- Drafting technical sections (methods, results, discussion)
- Reviewing research content for publication
- Ensuring IEEE format compliance
- User explicitly requests "use the writing_skills"
