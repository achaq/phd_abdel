@article{Ragragui2024,
abstract = {The Sa{\"{i}}ss basin in the Fez-Meknes region of Morocco, covering approximately 2100 km2, faces increased water demand due to population growth, economic development, and climate change, making groundwater a crucial resource. This study aims to delineate areas with groundwater potential (GWP) and evaluate the performance of various machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid ensemble models in predicting GWP. Using a dataset of 440 springs and wells, and 20 groundwater conditioning factors (GWCF) including topographical, hydrological, geological, and hydrogeological features, the study employed multi-collinearity analysis, variance inflation factor (VIF), tolerance (Tol) assessments, and an Information Gain (IG) test to analyze these factors. The study compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)), three deep learning algorithms (Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)), and a hybrid ensemble model (Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR)) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) as the evaluation metric. The results showed that the hybrid ensemble model had the highest AUC of 0.86, followed by GBC (AUC = 0.85), DLNN (AUC = 0.84), CNN (AUC = 0.83), KNN (AUC = 0.79), RNN (AUC = 0.78), and GNB (AUC = 0.75). The study revealed that 45% of the Sa{\"{i}}ss Basin exhibits high to very high GWP, particularly in Ain Taoujdat, Haj Kaddour, and Boufekrane districts, with lithology, slope, and transmissivity being the most influential factors. The resulting GWP map can guide decision-makers in planning well and borehole drilling for drinking water and agriculture, as well as artificial recharge projects, thus promoting sustainable groundwater management in the Sa{\"{i}}ss basin.},

abstract = {For 107 endemic mammal species in the Afro-Arabian region, Sahara-Sahel and Arabian Desert, we used ensemble species distribution models to: (1) identify the hotspot areas for conservation, (2) assess the potential impact of the projected climate change on the distribution of the focal species, and (3) assign IUCN threat categories for the focal species according to the predicted changes in their potential distribution range. We identified two main hotspot areas for endemic mammals: the Sinai and its surrounding coastal area in the East, and the Mediterranean Coast around Morocco in the West. Alarmingly, our results indicate that about 17% of the endemic mammals in the Afro-Arabian region under the current climate change scenarios could go extinct before 2050. Overall, a substantial number of the endemic species will change from the IUCN threat category “Least Concern” to “Critically Endangered” or “Extinct” in the coming decades. Accordingly, we call for implementing an urgent proactive conservation action for these endemic species, particularly those that face a high risk of extinction in the next few years. The results of our study provide conservation managers and practitioners with the required information for implementing an effective conservation plan to protect the biodiversity of the Afro-Arabian region.},

@misc{Ditria2022,
abstract = {Conservation of marine ecosystems has been highlighted as a priority to ensure a sustainable future. Effective management requires data collection over large spatio-temporal scales, readily accessible and integrated information from monitoring, and tools to support decision-making. However, there are many roadblocks to achieving adequate and timely information on both the effectiveness, and long-term success of conservation efforts, including limited funding, inadequate sampling, and data processing bottlenecks. These factors can result in ineffective, or even detrimental, management decisions in already impacted ecosystems. An automated approach facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) provides conservation managers with a toolkit that can help alleviate a number of these issues by reducing the monitoring bottlenecks and long-term costs of monitoring. Automating the collection, transfer, and processing of data provides managers access to greater information, thereby facilitating timely and effective management. Incorporating automation and big data availability into a decision support system with a user-friendly interface also enables effective adaptive management. We summarise the current state of artificial intelligence and automation techniques used in marine science and use examples in other disciplines to identify existing and potentially transferable methods that can enable automated monitoring and improve predictive modelling capabilities to support decision making. We also discuss emerging technologies that are likely to be useful as research in computer science and associated technologies continues to develop and become more accessible. Our perspective highlights the potential of AI and big data analytics for supporting decision-making, but also points to important knowledge gaps in multiple areas of the automation processes. These current challenges should be prioritised in conservation research to move toward implementing AI and automation in conservation management for a more informed understanding of impacted ecosystems to result in successful outcomes for conservation managers. We conclude that the current research and emphasis on automated and AI assisted tools in several scientific disciplines may mean the future of monitoring and management in marine science is facilitated and improved by the implementation of automation.},

@article{ElMezouary2024,
abstract = {Groundwater resources in Morocco often face sustainability challenges due to increased exploitation and climate change. Specifically, the Al-Haouz-Mejjate groundwater in the Marrakesh region is faced with overexploitation and insufficient recharge. However, the complex subsurface geometries hamper hydrogeological modeling, characterization, and effective management. Reliably estimating aquifer substrate topography is critical for groundwater models but is challenged by limited direct measurements. This study develops nonlinear machine learning models to infer substrate depths by fusing sparse borehole logs with regional geospatial data. A Gaussian process regression approach provided robust holistic mapping, leveraging flexibility, and uncertainty quantification. Supplementary neural network architectures focus on isolating specific variable relationships, like surface elevation–substrate. Model accuracy exceeded 0.8 R-squared against validation boreholes. Spatial visualizations confirmed consistency across landscape transects. Elevation and piezometric data proved most predictive, though multivariate inputs were required for the lowest errors. The results highlight the power of statistical learning to extract meaningful patterns from disparate hydrological data. However, model opacity and the need for broader training datasets remain barriers. Overall, the work demonstrates advanced machine learning as a promising avenue for illuminating complex aquifer geometries essential for sustainability. Hybrid approaches that use both data-driven and physics-based methods can help solve long-standing problems with hydrogeological characterization.},

abstract = {The Rabat–Sal{\'{e}}–K{\'{e}}nitra region of Morocco faces critical groundwater challenges due to increasing demands from population growth, agricultural expansion, and the impacts of prolonged droughts and climate change. This study employs advanced machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), gradient boosting (GB), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF), to predict groundwater storage variations. The dataset encompasses hydrological, meteorological, and geological factors. Among the models evaluated, RF demonstrated superior performance, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 484.800, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 22.018, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.986, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.981. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant insights into how different models respond to variations in key environmental factors such as evapotranspiration and precipitation. Prophet was also integrated for its ability to handle seasonality in time-series data, further enhancing prediction reliability. The findings emphasize the urgent need to integrate advanced predictive models into groundwater management to address groundwater depletion and ensure sustainable water resources amid rising drought conditions. Policymakers can use these models to regulate extraction, promote water-saving technologies, and enhance recharge efforts, ensuring the sustainability of vital groundwater resources for future generations.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to identify the groundwater storage areas in the middle Moulouya Basin by using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) methods which are the prominent supports of groundwater modeling. Five thematic maps of lithology, rainfall, drainage, lineaments, and slope; which were respectively categorized as they were weighed. Capaciously, they have been used to generate the map of potential groundwater storage zones. The results have shown that the area of very low to low potential surfaces represents approximately 10% of the total area, indicating that the middle Moulouya Basin is rich in groundwater, where more than 2200 wells and boreholes have been drilled. The obtained results have been validated with specific yield of springs in the study area. It indicates a clear correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the specific yield, this correlation is particularly obvious in light of yield of water points and their locations, indeed, most of water points with high yield are located in excellent potential zones, while poor potential zone includes the majority of water points with low yield.},

@article{Ayadi2025,
abstract = {The growing urgency of climate change necessitates innovative strategies to enhance system resilience across many sectors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a transformative tool in this regard, yet existing research remains fragmented across sectors and regions. We conducted a systematic literature review of 385 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and early 2025, following the PRISMA protocol. The analysis classifies AI applications across nine key sectors and evaluates their relevance to adaptation, mitigation, or both. AI methodologies and regional distribution were also assessed. The findings show a dominant focus on adaptation (64.4%), with only 16% of studies addressing mitigation, and 19.4% engaging both. Classical Machine Learning techniques are the most used (51.4%), followed by deep learning models (22.3%). Regional disparities are evident: Asia and global-scale studies account for two-thirds of the literature, while Africa and South America are underrepresented. Sectorally, agriculture and urban infrastructure receive the most attention. Despite the promise of AI, major challenges persist in data access, model transparency, and equitable deployment, particularly in vulnerable regions. This review distinguishes itself by offering a comprehensive, cross-sectoral synthesis and emphasizing system-level resilience. It highlights the need for regionally tailored AI solutions, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical frameworks to ensure AI contributes meaningfully to global climate resilience efforts.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production in Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) where the deleterious impacts of climate change are generally projected to be greatest. Design/methodology/approach – The study used a production function model using Fixed Effect Regression (FER) analysis and then using marginal impact analysis to assess the impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production. Therefore, the study utilized panel data for the period 1961-2009 pooled from 20 countries in MENA region. Findings – Results showed that 1 per cent increase in temperature during winter resulted in 1.12 per cent decrease in agricultural production. It was also observed that 1 per cent increase in temperature variability during winter and spring resulted in 0.09 and 0.14 per cent decrease in agricultural production, respectively. Results also indicated that increasing precipitation during winter and fall season and precipitation variability during winter and summer seasons had negative impact. The estimated parameters of square temperature and precipitation indicated that climate change has significant nonlinear impacts on agricultural production in MENA region. Originality/value – Despite there are many studies on the impact of climate change on agricultural production, there is a lack of publications to address the economic impact of both climate change and variability on agricultural production in MENA region. Thus, these results are more comprehensive and more informative to policymakers than the results from field trials.},

However, rapid expansion of developmental projects, agriculture, and urban areas threaten the country's rich biodiversity. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies like AI in Indian forests and biodiversity sectors can help in effective monitoring, management, and conservation of biodiversity and forest resources. We conducted a systematic search of literature related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) in the forestry sector and biodiversity conservation across globe and in India (using ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar). Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India.

abstract = {Groundwater resource management in arid regions has a critical importance for sustaining human activities and ecological systems. Accurate mapping of groundwater potential plays a vital role in effective water resource planning. This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Process in groundwater potential mapping (GWPM) in the Tan-Tan arid region, Morocco. Fourteen groundwater conditional factors were considered following multicollinearity test, including topographical, hydrological, climatic, and geological factors. Additionally, point data with 174 sites indicative of groundwater occurrences were incorporated. The groundwater inventory data underwent random partitioning into training and testing datasets at three different ratios: 55/45%, 65/35%, and 75/25%. Ultimately, a comprehensive ranking of the 13 models, encompassing both individual and ensemble models, was determined using the prioritization rank technique. The results revealed that ensemble learning (EL) models, particularly RF and Adaboost (RF-Adaboost), outperformed individual models in groundwater potential mapping. Based on accuracy assessment using the validation dataset, the RF-Adaboost EL results yielded an Area Under the Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Overall Accuracy (OA) of 94.02 and 94%, respectively. Ensemble models have been effectively applied to integrate 14 factors, capturing their intricate interrelationships, and thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of groundwater prediction in the Tan-Tan water-scarce region. Among the natural factors, the current study identified lithology, structural elements (such as faults and tectonic lineaments), and land use as significant contributors to groundwater potential. However, the critical characteristics of the study area showing a coastal position as well as a low background in groundwater prospectivity (low borehole points) are challenging in GWPM. The findings highlight the importance of the significant factors in assessing and managing groundwater resources in arid regions. Moreover, this study makes a contribution to the management of groundwater resources by demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble learning algorithms in the groundwater potential mapping (GWPM) in arid regions.},

abstract = {Human-induced climate change has been one of the most widely discussed issues of scientific and political spheres in the recent decades, and it has been overwhelmingly agreed that climate change poses a very serious threat for the environment and the economy. It has been observed that increasing temperatures and extremities in weather patterns create a serious challenge for agriculture and food security especially in various disadvantaged regions. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, where global mean temperatures rise by around 2°C by 2100, serious negative effects are expected on agricultural production and crop yields over the next century.The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is one of the most vulnerable regions as one of the most food-import dependent region in the world. Water resources are scarce and irrigation is not sufficiently developed in the region, and climate change hurts the already vulnerable agricultural supply, where on the other hand increasing population continuously fosters the demand for agricultural products.The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of climate change on agricultural trade in the MENA region. The indicators for climate change includes variables such as precipitation patterns and temperatures, and the effect of the change in the climate change indicators on agricultural exports and imports will be analyzed through a panel data analysis, where the impacts of GDP, per-capita oil use and trade integration will also be added as variables.},

abstract = {This study aimed to explore the diversity of natural landscapes, faunae, florae, and touristic infrastructures in Taza province and their attractiveness to visitors. Equally, visitors and local populations were interviewed on the socioeconomic activities in the study area. Field visits were realized to delimit the ecosystems, road network, and infrastructures in Taza province. Transects were used to collect faunae and florae data, while a questionnaire was used to collect demographic features and socioeconomic activities in Tazekka National Park. The obtained results showed a high diversity of ecosystems, including forests, steppes, farmlands, and aquatic systems. The documented faunae and florae were diverse with 86 avian species and 16 mammalian species. Two birds Carduelis carduelis and Streptopelia turtur arenicola were classified as vulnerable, while Neophron percnopterus was classified as an endangered species. Two mammals Macaca sylvanus and Cervus elaphus barbarus were endangered. The road network was advanced with four types of roads (highway, national, regional, and provincial) and hotel infrastructures (hotels, restaurants, diesel stations) were diverse and well distributed in each corner of the area. The availability of natural resources and well-developed infrastructures are suggested to support sustainable activities, such as ecotourism, which are expected to add income to local populations. In fact, field interviews showed that the area, principally Tazekka National Park was visited by national and international tourists, which creates jobs for local residents. Equally, many other activities such as agriculture, pastoralism, transportation, and commerce were recorded among the inhabitants. Therefore, more advanced research is needed to characterize new ecosystems that deserve tourist visits as well as how to balance between human activities and the sustainability of natural resources.},

abstract = {This study aims to analyze rainfall data series of four hydrometric stations in a mountainous context in Morocco, over the period 1970–2017. Periods of disruption were identified through statistical approaches based on rupture detection: the Pettitt test, the Bayesian procedure of Lee and Heghinian, and the Buishand test. The results show that the studied series are characterized by several breaks which indicate a variation in the overall trend of the rainfall regime during 1980, 1995, 2000, and around 2010. In addition, a diagnostic of dry and wet years is carried out by applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); a prolonged period of drought was observed from 1980 to 2010, with the exception of several short-term rainy events, such as in 1994–1996 and the early 2000s. The variability of spring discharge indicates an evolution consistent with that of rainfall; the largest decrease in flow rates was recorded during the period from 1980 to 1993. In addition, periods of abrupt increases were identified, with a maximum recorded in 1994–1996. The phase opposition showed a marked consistency between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the SPI, and the variability of spring discharge, which provides an overview of the influence of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and, consequently, on the availability of water resources in the area.},

abstract = {In the framework of the international CORDEX program, new regional climate model (RCM) simulations at high spatial resolutions are becoming available for the Mediterranean region (Med-CORDEX initiative). This study provides the first evaluation for hydrological impact studies of one of these high-resolution simulations in a 1800 km2 catchment located in North Morocco. Different approaches are compared to analyze the climate change impacts on the hydrology of this catchment using a high-resolution RCM (ALADIN-Climate) from the Med-CORDEX initiative at two different spatial resolutions (50 and 12 km) and for two different Radiative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The main issues addressed in the present study are: (i) what is the impact of increased RCM resolution on present-climate hydrological simulations and on future projections? (ii) Are the bias-correction of the RCM model and the parameters of the hydrological model stationary and transferable to different climatic conditions? (iii) What is the climate and hydrological change signal based on the new Radiative Concentration Pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)? Results indicate that high resolution simulations at 12 km better reproduce the seasonal patterns, the seasonal distributions and the extreme events of precipitation. The parameters of the hydrological model, calibrated to reproduce runoff at the monthly time step over the 1984-2010 period, do not show a strong variability between dry and wet calibration periods in a differential split-sample test. However the bias correction of precipitation by quantile-matching does not give satisfactory results in validation using the same differential split-sample testing method. Therefore a quantile-perturbation method that does not rely on any stationarity assumption and produces ensembles of perturbed series of precipitation was introduced. The climate change signal under scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 indicates a decrease of respectively-30 to-57% in surface runoff for the mid-term (2041-2062), when for the same period the projections for precipitation are ranging between-15 and-19% and for temperature between +1.3 and +1.9 ○ C. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.

This region is a good example of arid zones how know an important growth of agriculture, but there is under gap of geological, hydrogeological and soil knowledge. In the first time, we analyzed the Landsat 8-OLI image data with bands combination, ratios composition in RGB and filters to cartography the lithology's contours and lineament map. The false color composition of bands (765, 753, and 543) in RGB given the primary lithological delimitation. Supported by band rationing technique, we produced of 1/50000 geological map. The filter treatments given the lineament map superposed to the first one to realize geo-structural map. In addition, these images served to elaborate pedology map, using Decision Tree (Slope, Redness Index and Lithology parameters). Secondly, we established a GIS including the result map of RS treatment (lithology, lineament and soil maps) and additional spatial information (aquifer type and deep of groundwater surface and precipitations {\ldots}). In GIS, the vulnerability index are calculated using GOD and PI methods. Both of maps displayed four classes of vulnerability: between Low and Extreme in the first map, and Very low to High vulnerability in the second one. In the some areas, we have controversial values of vulnerability; this leads us to validate these maps using pollution indicators (NO3−, NH4+ and SO42−). The validation displayed that the PI coincides better with special concentrations of pollutants.},

abstract = {In a context of high stress on water resources and agricultural production at the global level, together with climate change marked by an increase in the frequency of these events, drought is considered to be a strong threat both socially and economically. The Mediterranean region is a hot spot of climate change; it is also characterized by a scarcity of water resources that places intense pressure on agricultural productivity. This article analyzes the potential for using multiple remote sensing tools in the quantification and predictability of drought in Northwest Africa. Three satellite products are considered: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Moisture Index (SWI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). A discussion of the variability of these products and their inter-correlation is presented, illustrating a generally high consistency between them. Statistical anomaly indices are then computed and a drought severity mapping is presented. The results illustrate in particular a high percentage of dry conditions in the region studied during the last ten years (2007–2017). Finally, we propose the use of the analog statistical approach to identify similar evolutions of the three variables in the past. Although this technique is not a forecast, it provides a strong indication of the plausible future trajectory of a given hydrological season.},

abstract = {Although Climate Change is a global phenomenon, the impact in Africa is anticipated to be greater than in many other parts of the world. This expectation is supported by many factors, including the relatively low shock tolerance of many African countries and the relatively high percentage of African workers engaged in the agricultural sector. High-income countries are increasingly turning their focus to climate change adaptation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a critical tool in those efforts. Algorithms using AI are making better predictions on the short- and long-term effects of climate change, including predictions related to weather patterns, floods and droughts, and human migration patterns. It is not clear, however, that Africa is (or will be) maximally benefitting from those AI tools, particularly since they are largely developed by highly developed countries using data sets that are specific to those same countries. It is therefore important to characterize the efforts underway to use AI in a way that specifically benefits Africa in climate change adaptation. These efforts include projects undertaken physically in Africa as well as those that have Africa as their focus. In exploring AI projects in or about Africa, this chapter also looks at the sufficiency of such efforts and the variety of approaches taken by researchers working with AI to address climate change in Africa.},

@article{Mahmood2023,
abstract = {Study region: Fensholt, Denmark. Study focus: Tile drains are commonly used in agricultural fields with loamy soils in Denmark to improve crop yield by removing excessive water. Spatial patterns of drain flows are controlled by the climate, geology, topography, and tile installation. We assessed the combined effect of topography and geology on spatial pattern of tile drain flows in 10 m resolution using numerical modelling. We developed three groundwater models using different geological models by integrating high-resolution data from geophysical methods with field estimated hydraulic conductivity. New insights: The mapping and modelling revealed small geological features of higher hydraulic conductivity in clayey-till. The results showed that the spatial patterns of drain flows to recharge ratio (drainage fraction, DF) are driven by topography; the models had a high DF in local depressions and a low DF in local hills. The DF was related to the Topographical Position Index (TPI), suggesting that the DF is controlled by small-scale topography both upstream and downstream of the study area. We found that geology amplifies the spatial patterns of tile drain flows; a higher hydraulic conductivity relative to a lower hydraulic conductivity increases the change of tile drain flow for a one-unit change in the TPI. This was attributed to a change from small-scale flow systems to field-scale flow systems. The study suggested that topography helps to delineate high and low DF while geology controls the magnitude of DF. The study emphasized the importance of mapping and modeling of geology for managing moraine agricultural areas that can be found in parts of North America and Scandinavia for agricultural water management.},

abstract = {The present study evaluates the future drought hazard in Morocco using a Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) approach. First, the artificial neural network-based MME is constructed using the General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Climate Models Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) which are most successful in representing the historical temperature and precipitation values. Next, the future changes in the precipitation, Potential EvapoTranspiration (PET) calculated using temperatures data, aridity index, and drought indices calculated via the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) values were projected for the historical period 1980-2014, near future 2025-2050, mid future 2051-2075, and far future 2076-2100. The obtained results indicate that there will be a decrease in values of the precipitation and an increase in values of the PET, leading to an increase in aridity risk for Morocco. The future projections using the SPEI results show that the average index values will mostly be in the drought zone, indicating that the drought severity will increase. The spatial analysis of SPEI values in different regions of Morocco demonstrates that the northern part of the country has relatively more drought occurrences, and drought severity tends to increase with each passing period. The study also reveals that drought severity will significantly increase after 2050 in the Shared Socio-economic Pathways 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario. The research concludes that the increase in drought severity will significantly impact Morocco's water resources, agriculture and food security among others.},

abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL.

While less pronounced and fewer significant trends can be found under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, we detect significantly declining trends of groundwater levels for most of the sites under RCP8.5, revealing a spatial pattern of stronger decreases, especially in the northern and eastern part of Germany, emphasizing already existing decreasing trends in these regions.

abstract = {The parameterization of moist convection contributes to uncertainty in climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here, we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and non-negativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment.},

abstract = {Understanding the characteristics contributing to enhancing flood resilience is a matter of urgency in managing urban areas, especially for developing countries, given the challenges imposed by climate change, social growth and urbanization. Identifying resilience metrics remains challenging, mainly because the concept is relatively new, methodological approaches are almost absent, and many types of resilience-related data are still unavailable. A number of indices for flood resilience have been introduced in the literature, typically based on clustering algorithms that allow complex behaviors to be mapped to specific levels of resilience. Consequently, the qualitative aspects of such indices are highly sensitive to the availability, quality and heterogeneity of data. Historically, this assessment has often been performed using rather simple algorithms such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Whilst they allow reliable resilience metrics in some areas, their use in a complex urban system such as the northern coastal area in Morocco is arguable. In the present study, we introduce an advanced Machine Learning (ML) method, namely the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to build a Flood Resilience Index (FRI). Compared to classical methodologies, this present technique allows an improved assimilation of the complex relationship between data representing the social, economic and physical status of the area and resilience level. The success of this approach is mainly due to the ability of SOM to deal with complex, heterogeneous and sparse datasets. The results demonstrate great potential for such algorithms to shed light on systems that are too complex for classical techniques.},

abstract = {Mediterranean countries are strongly affected by reduced surface water resources. This study aims to assess the climate change impacts on runoff supply to the Bin El Ouidane dam in Morocco, the largest in the country in terms of hydropower production. A water balance model coupled with a stochastic calibration method to provide confidence intervals on simulated discharge is used to reproduce discharge using observed and bias-corrected ECMWF Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) rainfall (WFDE5). Five regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX initiative are considered to estimate the climate change impacts on surface runoff for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5) and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results indicate a future increase in evapotranspiration (+15 to +36%) associated with a decrease in precipitation (−16 to −34%) in both climate scenarios. The hydrological projections indicated a significant decrease in runoff (−57 to −86%), more severe when the model is driven by WFDE5 compared to observed precipitation. Consequently, the strong decline of surface water resources imply a change in water ressource management for hydropower production and local agriculture to adapt to the future climatic conditions.},

As part of our research on jellyfish that swarm in the bay of Al Hoceima conducted during the period (2021-2022), a study of the diversity of species of jellyfish in the bay has proved to be of paramount importance because of the risks associated with their proliferation, especially in summer periods. The species composition and frequency of occurrence of the jellyfish community in Al Hoceima Bay (The northern coast of Morocco) were studied during two seasons, summer 2021 and winter 2022. Zooplankton sampling was conducted within the epileptic layer (between 0 and 80 m) at 9 stations. A total of 9 species of Hydromedusae and Scyphomedusae were identified in the study area. The populations of Hydromedusae are represented by Trchymedusae (4 species), Anthomedusae (2 species), and Leptomedusae (one species). The Trachymedusa Aglaura hemistoma was widely distributed in the bay, as it was found in six sampling stations, with a frequency of occurrence Fi66% during the summer period. The Antomedusae Pantachogon militare was inventoried for the first time in the southwestern Mediterranean Sea.The population of Scyphomedusae is represented by two species, Pelagia noctiluca and Rhizostoma Pulmo, both species showed dense aggregations in the Bay during the summer of 2022.},

abstract = {Study region: The upstream part of the Essaouira basin, a data-scare region in Morocco, Northwestern Africa. Study focus: The scarcity of hydro-climate data is a significant challenge found in several regions worldwide, where qualitative and quantitative water resource information remains limited. Estimating and predicting groundwater levels (GWL) in such areas is a significant challenge in producing knowledge for effective water resource management. To address this issue, the present study aimed to use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in conjunction with downscaled total water storage (TWS) data (9 km) obtained from Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and machine learning techniques, specifically random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to estimate and predict the variation in GWL. New hydrological insights for the region: This study constitutes a first of its kind in the study area; the SWAT model was set up for 10 years, with a warm-up period from 2000 to 2001, calibration from 2002 to 2007, and validation from 2008 to 2010. The statistical indices (Coefficient of Determination (R²) ≥ 0.73, R² ≥ 0.78, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) ≥ 0.67, NSE ≥ 0.80 respectively for calibration and validation) highlight a significant correlation, implying the model's capability to faithfully reproduce the streamflow. The downscaled TWS demonstrates an impressive ability to identify and monitor fluctuations in GWL. Using machine learning algorithms (RF and SVR), the prediction of GWL yielded satisfactory results, NSE = 0.78 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.33, NSE = 0.51 and RMSE = 0.49 for the RF and SVR, respectively. Despite some limitations, our approach provided promising results in GWL prediction, with the possibility of expanding to other data-scarce regions.},

This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular.

The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change.

Increase in average global temperature and extreme and unpredictable weather are the most common manifestations of climate change. In recent years, it has acquired the importance of global emergency and affecting not only the wellbeing of humans but also the sustainability of other lifeforms. Enormous increase in the emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane and nitrous oxide) in recent decades largely due to burning of coal and fossil fuels, and deforestation are the main drivers of climate change. Marked increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, rise in sea level, decrease in crop productivity and loss of biodiversity are the main consequences of climate change. Obvious mitigation measures include significant reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and increase in the forest cover of the landmass. Conference of Parties (COP 21), held in Paris in 2015 adapted, as a legally binding treaty, to limit global warming to well below 2 °C, preferably to 1.5 °C by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels. However, under the present emission scenario, the world is heading for a 3–4 °C warming by the end of the century. This was discussed further in COP 26 held in Glasgow in November 2021; many countries pledged to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050 and to end deforestation, essential requirements to keep 1.5 °C target. However, even with implementation of these pledges, the rise is expected to be around 2.4 °C. Additional measures are urgently needed to realize the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C and to sustain biodiversity and human welfare.},

abstract = {Accurate seasonal forecasting of cereal yields is an important decision support tool for countries, such as Morocco, that are not self-sufficient in order to predict, as early as possible, importation needs. This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1 . The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.},

Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India.

This study aims to delineate areas with groundwater potential (GWP) and evaluate the performance of various machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid ensemble models in predicting GWP. Using a dataset of 440 springs and wells, and 20 groundwater conditioning factors (GWCF) including topographical, hydrological, geological, and hydrogeological features, the study employed multi-collinearity analysis, variance inflation factor (VIF), tolerance (Tol) assessments, and an Information Gain (IG) test to analyze these factors. The study compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)), three deep learning algorithms (Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)), and a hybrid ensemble model (Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR)) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) as the evaluation metric. The results showed that the hybrid ensemble model had the highest AUC of 0.86, followed by GBC (AUC = 0.85), DLNN (AUC = 0.84), CNN (AUC = 0.83), KNN (AUC = 0.79), RNN (AUC = 0.78), and GNB (AUC = 0.75).

We identified two main hotspot areas for endemic mammals: the Sinai and its surrounding coastal area in the East, and the Mediterranean Coast around Morocco in the West. Alarmingly, our results indicate that about 17% of the endemic mammals in the Afro-Arabian region under the current climate change scenarios could go extinct before 2050. Overall, a substantial number of the endemic species will change from the IUCN threat category “Least Concern” to “Critically Endangered” or “Extinct” in the coming decades. Accordingly, we call for implementing an urgent proactive conservation action for these endemic species, particularly those that face a high risk of extinction in the next few years. The results of our study provide conservation managers and practitioners with the required information for implementing an effective conservation plan to protect the biodiversity of the Afro-Arabian region.},

abstract = {Conservation of marine ecosystems has been highlighted as a priority to ensure a sustainable future. Effective management requires data collection over large spatio-temporal scales, readily accessible and integrated information from monitoring, and tools to support decision-making. However, there are many roadblocks to achieving adequate and timely information on both the effectiveness, and long-term success of conservation efforts, including limited funding, inadequate sampling, and data processing bottlenecks. These factors can result in ineffective, or even detrimental, management decisions in already impacted ecosystems. An automated approach facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) provides conservation managers with a toolkit that can help alleviate a number of these issues by reducing the monitoring bottlenecks and long-term costs of monitoring. Automating the collection, transfer, and processing of data provides managers access to greater information, thereby facilitating timely and effective management. Incorporating automation and big data availability into a decision support system with a user-friendly interface also enables effective adaptive management. We summarise the current state of artificial intelligence and automated monitoring for assisting conservation of marine ecosystems and use examples in other disciplines to identify existing and potentially transferable methods that can enable automated monitoring and improve predictive modelling capabilities to support decision making. We also discuss emerging technologies that are likely to be useful as research in computer science and associated technologies continues to develop and become more accessible. Our perspective highlights the potential of AI and big data analytics for supporting decision-making, but also points to important knowledge gaps in multiple areas of the automation processes. These current challenges should be prioritised in conservation research to move toward implementing AI and automation... [truncated]

abstract = {Groundwater resources in Morocco often face sustainability challenges due to increased exploitation and climate change. Specifically, the Al-Haouz-Mejjate groundwater in the Marrakesh region is faced with overexploitation and insufficient recharge. However, the complex subsurface geometries hamper hydrogeological modeling, characterization, and effective management. Reliably estimating aquifer substrate topography is critical for groundwater models but is challenged by limited direct measurements. This study develops nonlinear machine learning models to infer substrate depths by fusing sparse borehole logs with regional geospatial data. A Gaussian process regression approach provided robust holistic mapping, leveraging flexibility, and uncertainty quantification. Supplementary neural network architectures focus on isolating specific variable relationships, like surface elevation–substrate. Model accuracy exceeded 0.8 R-squared against validation boreholes. Spatial visualizations confirmed consistency across landscape transects. Elevation and piezometric data proved most predictive, though multivariate inputs were required for the lowest errors. The results highlight the power of statistical learning to extract meaningful patterns from disparate hydrological data. However, model opacity and the need for broader training datasets remain barriers. Overall, the work demonstrates advanced machine learning as a promising avenue for illuminating complex aquifer geometries essential for sustainability. Hybrid approaches that use both data-driven and physics-based methods can help solve long-standing problems with hydrogeological characterization.},

The dataset encompasses hydrological, meteorological, and geological factors. Among the models evaluated, RF demonstrated superior performance, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 484.800, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 22.018, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.986, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.981. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant insights into how different models respond to variations in key environmental factors such as evapotranspiration and precipitation. Prophet was also integrated for its ability to handle seasonality in time-series data, further enhancing prediction reliability. The findings emphasize the urgent need to integrate advanced predictive models into groundwater management to address groundwater depletion and ensure sustainable water resources amid rising drought conditions. Policymakers can use these models to regulate extraction, promote water-saving technologies, and enhance recharge efforts, ensuring the sustainability of vital groundwater resources for future generations.},

Capaciously, they have been used to generate the map of potential groundwater storage zones. The results have shown that the area of very low to low potential surfaces represents approximately 10% of the total area, indicating that the middle Moulouya Basin is rich in groundwater, where more than 2200 wells and boreholes have been drilled. The obtained results have been validated with specific yield of springs in the study area. It indicates a clear correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the specific yield, this correlation is particularly obvious in light of yield of water points and their locations, indeed, most of water points with high yield are located in excellent potential zones, while poor potential zone includes the majority of water points with low yield.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a transformative tool in this regard, yet existing research remains fragmented across sectors and regions. We conducted a systematic literature review of 385 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and early 2025, following the PRISMA protocol. The analysis classifies AI applications across nine key sectors and evaluates their relevance to adaptation, mitigation, or both. AI methodologies and regional distribution were also assessed. The findings show a dominant focus on adaptation (64.4%), with only 16% of studies addressing mitigation, and 19.4% engaging both. Classical Machine Learning techniques are the most used (51.4%), followed by deep learning models (22.3%). Regional disparities are evident: Asia and global-scale studies account for two-thirds of the literature, while Africa and South America are underrepresented. Sectorally, agriculture and urban infrastructure receive the most attention. Despite the promise of AI, major challenges persist in data access, model transparency, and equitable deployment, particularly in vulnerable regions. This review distinguishes itself by offering a comprehensive, cross-sectoral synthesis and emphasizing system-level resilience. It highlights the need for regionally tailored AI solutions, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical frameworks to ensure AI contributes meaningfully to global climate resilience efforts.},

Design/methodology/approach – The study used a production function model using Fixed Effect Regression (FER) analysis and then using marginal impact analysis to assess the impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production. Therefore, the study utilized panel data for the period 1961-2009 pooled from 20 countries in MENA region. Findings – Results showed that 1 per cent increase in temperature during winter resulted in 1.12 per cent decrease in agricultural production. It was also observed that 1 per cent increase in temperature variability during winter and spring resulted in 0.09 and 0.14 per cent decrease in agricultural production, respectively. Results also indicated that increasing precipitation during winter and fall season and precipitation variability during winter and summer seasons had negative impact. The estimated parameters of square temperature and precipitation indicated that climate change has significant nonlinear impacts on agricultural production in MENA region. Originality/value – Despite there are many studies on the impact of climate change on agricultural production, there is a lack of publications to address the economic impact of both climate change and variability on agricultural production in MENA region. Thus, these results are more comprehensive and more informative to policymakers than the results from field trials.},

Accurate mapping of groundwater potential plays a vital role in effective water resource planning. This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Process in groundwater potential mapping (GWPM) in the Tan-Tan arid region, Morocco. Fourteen groundwater conditional factors were considered following multicollinearity test, including topographical, hydrological, climatic, and geological factors. Additionally, point data with 174 sites indicative of groundwater occurrences were incorporated. The groundwater inventory data underwent random partitioning into training and testing datasets at three different ratios: 55/45%, 65/35%, and 75/25%. Ultimately, a comprehensive ranking of the 13 models, encompassing both individual and ensemble models, was determined using the prioritization rank technique. The results revealed that ensemble learning (EL) models, particularly RF and Adaboost (RF-Adaboost), outperformed individual models in groundwater potential mapping. Based on accuracy assessment using the validation dataset, the RF-Adaboost EL results yielded an Area Under the Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Overall Accuracy (OA) of 94.02 and 94%, respectively.

It has been observed that increasing temperatures and extremities in weather patterns create a serious challenge for agriculture and food security especially in various disadvantaged regions. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, where global mean temperatures rise by around 2°C by 2100, serious negative effects are expected on agricultural production and crop yields over the next century.The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is one of the most vulnerable regions as one of the most food-import dependent region in the world. Water resources are scarce and irrigation is not sufficiently developed in the region, and climate change hurts the already vulnerable agricultural supply, where on the other hand increasing population continuously fosters the demand for agricultural products.The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of climate change on agricultural trade in the MENA region. The indicators for climate change includes variables such as precipitation patterns and temperatures, and the effect of the change in the climate change indicators on agricultural exports and imports will be analyzed through a panel data analysis, where the impacts of GDP, per-capita oil use and trade integration will also be added as variables.},

Transects were used to collect faunae and florae data, while a questionnaire was used to collect demographic features and socioeconomic activities in Tazekka National Park. The obtained results showed a high diversity of ecosystems, including forests, steppes, farmlands, and aquatic systems. The documented faunae and florae were diverse with 86 avian species and 16 mammalian species. Two birds Carduelis carduelis and Streptopelia turtur arenicola were classified as vulnerable, while Neophron percnopterus was classified as an endangered species. Two mammals Macaca sylvanus and Cervus elaphus barbarus were endangered. The road network was advanced with four types of roads (highway, national, regional, and provincial) and hotel infrastructures (hotels, restaurants, diesel stations) were diverse and well distributed in each corner of the area. The availability of natural resources and well-developed infrastructures are suggested to support sustainable activities, such as ecotourism, which are expected to add income to local populations. In fact, field interviews showed that the area, principally Tazekka National Park was visited by national and international tourists, which creates jobs for local residents. Equally, many other activities such as agriculture, pastoralism, transportation, and commerce were recorded among the inhabitants. Therefore, more advanced research is needed to characterize new ecosystems that deserve tourist visits as well as how to balance between human activities and the sustainability of natural resources.},

Periods of disruption were identified through statistical approaches based on rupture detection: the Pettitt test, the Bayesian procedure of Lee and Heghinian, and the Buishand test. The results show that the studied series are characterized by several breaks which indicate a variation in the overall trend of the rainfall regime during 1980, 1995, 2000, and around 2010. In addition, a diagnostic of dry and wet years is carried out by applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); a prolonged period of drought was observed from 1980 to 2010, with the exception of several short-term rainy events, such as in 1994–1996 and the early 2000s. The variability of spring discharge indicates an evolution consistent with that of rainfall; the largest decrease in flow rates was recorded during the period from 1980 to 1993. In addition, periods of abrupt increases were identified, with a maximum recorded in 1994–1996. The phase opposition showed a marked consistency between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the SPI, and the variability of spring discharge, which provides an overview of the influence of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and, consequently, on the availability of water resources in the area.},

abstract = {In the framework of the international CORDEX program, new regional climate model (RCM) simulations at high spatial resolutions are becoming available for the Mediterranean region (Med-CORDEX initiative). This study provides the first evaluation for hydrological impact studies of one of these high-resolution simulations in a 1800 km2 catchment located in North Morocco. Different approaches are compared to analyze the climate change impacts on the hydrology of this catchment using a high-resolution RCM (ALADIN-Climate) from the Med-CORDEX initiative at two different spatial resolutions (50 and 12 km) and for two different Radiative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The main issues addressed in the present study are: (i) what is the impact of increased RCM resolution on present-climate hydrological simulations and on future projections? (ii) Are the bias-correction of the RCM model and the parameters of the hydrological model stationary and transferable to different climatic conditions? (iii) What is the climate and hydrological change signal based on the new Radiative Concentration Pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)? Results indicate that high resolution simulations at 12 km better reproduce the seasonal patterns, the seasonal distributions and the extreme events of precipitation. The parameters of the hydrological model, calibrated to reproduce runoff at the monthly time step over the 1984-2010 period, do not show a strong variability between dry and wet calibration periods in a differential split-sample test. However the bias correction of precipitation by quantile-matching does not give satisfactory results in validation using the same differential split-sample testing method. Therefore a quantile-perturbation method that does not rely on any stationarity assumption and produces ensembles of perturbed series of precipitation was introduced. The climate change signal under scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 indicates a decrease of respectively-... [truncated]

This region is a good example of arid zones how know an important growth of agriculture, but there is under gap of geological, hydrogeological and soil knowledge. In the first time, we analyzed the Landsat 8-OLI image data with bands combination, ratios composition in RGB and filters to cartography the lithology's contours and lineament map. The false color composition of bands (765, 753, and 543) in RGB given the primary lithological delimitation. Supported by band rationing technique, we produced of 1/50000 geological map. The filter treatments given the lineament map superposed to the first one to realize geo-structural map. In addition, these images served to elaborate pedology map, using Decision Tree (Slope, Redness Index and Lithology parameters). Secondly, we established a GIS including the result map of RS treatment (lithology, lineament and soil maps) and additional spatial information (aquifer type and deep of groundwater surface and precipitations {\ldots}). In GIS, the vulnerability index are calculated using GOD and PI methods. Both of maps displayed four classes of vulnerability: between Low and Extreme in the first map, and Very low to High vulnerability in the second one. In the some areas, we have controversial values of vulnerability; this leads us to validate these maps using pollution indicators (NO3−, NH4+ and SO42−). The validation displayed that the PI coincides better with special concentrations of pollutants.},

abstract = {In a context of high stress on water resources and agricultural production at the global level, together with climate change marked by an increase in the frequency of these events, drought is considered to be a strong threat both socially and economically. The Mediterranean region is a hot spot of climate change; it is also characterized by a scarcity of water resources that places intense pressure on agricultural productivity. This article analyzes the potential for using multiple remote sensing tools in the quantification and predictability of drought in Northwest Africa. Three satellite products are considered: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Moisture Index (SWI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). A discussion of the variability of these products and their inter-correlation is presented, illustrating a generally high consistency between them. Statistical anomaly indices are then computed and a drought severity mapping is presented. The results illustrate in particular a high percentage of dry conditions in the region studied during the last ten years (2007–2017). Finally, we propose the use of the analog statistical approach to identify similar evolutions of the three variables in the past. Although this technique is not a forecast, it provides a strong indication of the plausible future trajectory of a given hydrological season.},

abstract = {Although Climate Change is a global phenomenon, the impact in Africa is anticipated to be greater than in many other parts of the world. This expectation is supported by many factors, including the relatively low shock tolerance of many African countries and the relatively high percentage of African workers engaged in the agricultural sector. High-income countries are increasingly turning their focus to climate change adaptation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a critical tool in those efforts. Algorithms using AI are making better predictions on the short- and long-term effects of climate change, including predictions related to weather patterns, floods and droughts, and human migration patterns. It is not clear, however, that Africa is (or will be) maximally benefitting from those AI tools, particularly since they are largely developed by highly developed countries using data sets that are specific to those same countries. It is therefore important to characterize the efforts underway to use AI in a way that specifically benefits Africa in climate change adaptation. These efforts include projects undertaken physically in Africa as well as those that have Africa as their focus. In exploring AI projects in or about Africa, this chapter also looks at the sufficiency of such efforts and the variety of approaches taken by researchers working with AI to address climate change in Africa.},

abstract = {Study region: Fensholt, Denmark. Study focus: Tile drains are commonly used in agricultural fields with loamy soils in Denmark to improve crop yield by removing excessive water. Spatial patterns of drain flows are controlled by the climate, geology, topography, and tile installation. We assessed the combined effect of topography and geology on spatial pattern of tile drain flows in 10 m resolution using numerical modelling. We developed three groundwater models using different geological models by integrating high-resolution data from geophysical methods with field estimated hydraulic conductivity. New insights: The mapping and modelling revealed small geological features of higher hydraulic conductivity in clayey-till. The results showed that the spatial patterns of drain flows to recharge ratio (drainage fraction, DF) are driven by topography; the models had a high DF in local depressions and a low DF in local hills. The DF was related to the Topographical Position Index (TPI), suggesting that the DF is controlled by small-scale topography both upstream and downstream of the study area. We found that geology amplifies the spatial patterns of tile drain flows; a higher hydraulic conductivity relative to a lower hydraulic conductivity increases the change of tile drain flow for a one-unit change in the TPI. This was attributed to a change from small-scale flow systems to field-scale flow systems. The study suggested that topography helps to delineate high and low DF while geology controls the magnitude of DF. The study emphasized the importance of mapping and modeling of geology for managing moraine agricultural areas that can be found in parts of North America and Scandinavia for agricultural water management.},

abstract = {The present study evaluates the future drought hazard in Morocco using a Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) approach. First, the artificial neural network-based MME is constructed using the General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Climate Models Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) which are most successful in representing the historical temperature and precipitation values. Next, the future changes in the precipitation, Potential EvapoTranspiration (PET) calculated using temperatures data, aridity index, and drought indices calculated via the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) values were projected for the historical period 1980-2014, near future 2025-2050, mid future 2051-2075, and far future 2076-2100. The obtained results indicate that there will be a decrease in values of the precipitation and an increase in values of the PET, leading to an increase in aridity risk for Morocco. The future projections using the SPEI results show that the average index values will mostly be in the drought zone, indicating that the drought severity will increase. The spatial analysis of SPEI values in different regions of Morocco demonstrates that the northern part of the country has relatively more drought occurrences, and drought severity tends to increase with each passing period. The study also reveals that drought severity will significantly increase after 2050 in the Shared Socio-economic Pathways 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario. The research concludes that the increase in drought severity will significantly impact Morocco's water resources, agriculture and food security among others.},

Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net).

abstract = {The parameterization of moist convection contributes to uncertainty in climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here, we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and non-negativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment.},

abstract = {Understanding the characteristics contributing to enhancing flood resilience is a matter of urgency in managing urban areas, especially for developing countries, given the challenges imposed by climate change, social growth and urbanization. Identifying resilience metrics remains challenging, mainly because the concept is relatively new, methodological approaches are almost absent, and many types of resilience-related data are still unavailable. A number of indices for flood resilience have been introduced in the literature, typically based on clustering algorithms that allow complex behaviors to be mapped to specific levels of resilience. Consequently, the qualitative aspects of such indices are highly sensitive to the availability, quality and heterogeneity of data. Historically, this assessment has often been performed using rather simple algorithms such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Whilst they allow reliable resilience metrics in some areas, their use in a complex urban system such as the northern coastal area in Morocco is arguable. In the present study, we introduce an advanced Machine Learning (ML) method, namely the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to build a Flood Resilience Index (FRI). Compared to classical methodologies, this present technique allows an improved assimilation of the complex relationship between data representing the social, economic and physical status of the area and resilience level. The success of this approach is mainly due to the ability of SOM to deal with complex, heterogeneous and sparse datasets. The results demonstrate great potential for such algorithms to shed light on systems that are too complex for classical techniques.},

This study aims to assess the climate change impacts on runoff supply to the Bin El Ouidane dam in Morocco, the largest in the country in terms of hydropower production. A water balance model coupled with a stochastic calibration method to provide confidence intervals on simulated discharge is used to reproduce discharge using observed and bias-corrected ECMWF Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) rainfall (WFDE5). Five regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX initiative are considered to estimate the climate change impacts on surface runoff for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5) and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results indicate a future increase in evapotranspiration (+15 to +36%) associated with a decrease in precipitation (−16 to −34%) in both climate scenarios. The hydrological projections indicated a significant decrease in runoff (−57 to −86%), more severe when the model is driven by WFDE5 compared to observed precipitation. Consequently, the strong decline of surface water resources imply a change in water ressource management for hydropower production and local agriculture to adapt to the future climatic conditions.},

As part of our research on jellyfish that swarm in the bay of Al Hoceima conducted during the period (2021-2022), a study of the diversity of species of jellyfish in the bay has proved to be of paramount importance because of the risks associated with their proliferation, especially in summer periods. The species composition and frequency of occurrence of the jellyfish community in Al Hoceima Bay (The northern coast of Morocco) were studied during two seasons, summer 2021 and winter 2022. Zooplankton sampling was conducted within the epileptic layer (between 0 and 80 m) at 9 stations. A total of 9 species of Hydromedusae and Scyphomedusae were identified in the study area. The populations of Hydromedusae are represented by Trchymedusae (4 species), Anthomedusae (2 species), and Leptomedusae (one species). The Trachymedusa Aglaura hemistoma was widely distributed in the bay, as it was found in six sampling stations, with a frequency of occurrence Fi66% during the summer period. The Antomedusae Pantachogon militare was inventoried for the first time in the southwestern Mediterranean Sea.The population of Scyphomedusae is represented by two species, Pelagia noctiluca and Rhizostoma Pulmo, both species showed dense aggregations in the Bay during the summer of 2022.},

abstract = {Study region: The upstream part of the Essaouira basin, a data-scare region in Morocco, Northwestern Africa. Study focus: The scarcity of hydro-climate data is a significant challenge found in several regions worldwide, where qualitative and quantitative water resource information remains limited. Estimating and predicting groundwater levels (GWL) in such areas is a significant challenge in producing knowledge for effective water resource management. To address this issue, the present study aimed to use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in conjunction with downscaled total water storage (TWS) data (9 km) obtained from Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and machine learning techniques, specifically random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to estimate and predict the variation in GWL. New hydrological insights for the region: This study constitutes a first of its kind in the study area; the SWAT model was set up for 10 years, with a warm-up period from 2000 to 2001, calibration from 2002 to 2007, and validation from 2008 to 2010. The statistical indices (Coefficient of Determination (R²) ≥ 0.73, R² ≥ 0.78, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) ≥ 0.67, NSE ≥ 0.80 respectively for calibration and validation) highlight a significant correlation, implying the model's capability to faithfully reproduce the streamflow. The downscaled TWS demonstrates an impressive ability to identify and monitor fluctuations in GWL. Using machine learning algorithms (RF and SVR), the prediction of GWL yielded satisfactory results, NSE = 0.78 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.33, NSE = 0.51 and RMSE = 0.49 for the RF and SVR, respectively. Despite some limitations, our approach provided promising results in GWL prediction, with the possibility of expanding to other data-scarce regions.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is believed to have a significant potential use in tackling climate change. This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that, provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate.},

abstract = {Climate change refers to the long-term changes in temperature and weather due to human activities. Increase in average global temperature and extreme and unpredictable weather are the most common manifestations of climate change. In recent years, it has acquired the importance of global emergency and affecting not only the wellbeing of humans but also the sustainability of other lifeforms. Enormous increase in the emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane and nitrous oxide) in recent decades largely due to burning of coal and fossil fuels, and deforestation are the main drivers of climate change. Marked increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, rise in sea level, decrease in crop productivity and loss of biodiversity are the main consequences of climate change. Obvious mitigation measures include significant reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and increase in the forest cover of the landmass. Conference of Parties (COP 21), held in Paris in 2015 adapted, as a legally binding treaty, to limit global warming to well below 2 °C, preferably to 1.5 °C by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels. However, under the present emission scenario, the world is heading for a 3–4 °C warming by the end of the century. This was discussed further in COP 26 held in Glasgow in November 2021; many countries pledged to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050 and to end deforestation, essential requirements to keep 1.5 °C target. However, even with implementation of these pledges, the rise is expected to be around 2.4 °C. Additional measures are urgently needed to realize the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C and to sustain biodiversity and human welfare.},

Morocco, with its vast agricultural potential, is in need of advanced technologies to optimize crop productivity. Precision farming is one such technology, which incorporates the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze data from various sources and make informed decisions about crop management. In this study, we propose a web-based crop recommendation system that leverages ML algorithms to predict the most suitable crop to harvest based on environmental factors such as soil nutrient levels, temperature, and precipitations. We evaluated the performance of five ML algorithms (Decision Tree, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine) and identified Random Forest as the best-performing algorithm. Despite the promising results, we faced several challenges, including limited availability of data and the need for field validation of the results. Nonetheless, our platform aims to provide free and open-source precision farming solutions to Moroccan farmers to improve agricultural productivity and contribute to sustainable economic growth in the country},

@article{Bouras2021,
abstract = {Accurate seasonal forecasting of cereal yields is an important decision support tool for countries, such as Morocco, that are not self-sufficient in order to predict, as early as possible, importation needs. This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1 . The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training ...

abstract = {The recent advancement in data science coupled with the revolution in digital and satellite technology has improved the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the forestry and wildlife sectors. India shares 7% of global forest cover and is the 8th most biodiverse region in the world. However, rapid expansion of developmental projects, agriculture, and urban areas threaten the country's rich biodiversity. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies like AI in Indian forests and biodiversity sectors can help in effective monitoring, management, and conservation of biodiversity and forest resources. We conducted a systematic search of literature related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) in the forestry sector and biodiversity conservation across globe and in India (using ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar). Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India. We hope that this synthesis will motivate forest officials, scientists, and conservationists in India to explore AI technology for biodiversity conservation and forest management.},
